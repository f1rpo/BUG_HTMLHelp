<P>This is a simple mod to give yourself reminders.</P>
<P>The commands <b>Alt+M</b> and <b>Alt+Ctrl+R</b> create a pop up window in which you can write the text of the reminder 
and set the number of turns until the reminder goes off. 
When that turn comes around, your reminder will appear as a message on the screen and in the event log (but only for a few turns). 
Also an alarm noise will play to get your attention.<br>
You can have as many reminders pending as you like. <br>
As of now there is no way to eliminate a reminder (other than passing the turn it is set to go off) or any way to view the current reminders.</P>
<br>

<P CLASS="style1">Instructions</P>
<P>Reminders can be configured in the <A HREF="../Options/Alerts.html">Alerts</A> tab of the <b><i>BUG Options Screen</i></b> (<b>Alt+Ctrl+O</b>).
To enable Reminders, you simply have to select the <i>'Enable Reminders'</i> checkbox.<br>
You can also choose a <i>'Display Method'</i> selecting your favourite entry: 
<i>'Message'</i> will display a message on the screen (and will add an entry in the log if the <i>'Log with Autolog'</i> checkbox is selected), 
<i>'Popup'</i>  will display a popup window in which the player can extend that reminder to next turn, 
<i>'Both'</i> will do both things above.<br>
The <i>'Log with Autolog'</i> checkbox, as mentioned, will enable the logging of reminders (both their creation and their trigging) 
within <A HREF="../IncludedMods/Autolog.html">Autolog</A>.</P>
<P>Once the mod has been enabled (as explained above), to create a new reminder the player simply has to press <b>Alt+M</b> (or <b>Alt+Ctrl+R</b>) 
to open a popup window in the main game interface.</P>
