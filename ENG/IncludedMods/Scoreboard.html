<br>

<P>This mod is released only as a component of the <b>BUG Mod</b>, not as a stand-alone mod.</P>
<P>This mod provides a fully customizable Scoreboard. 
It allows you to specify exactly which pieces to show and in what order. 
It also adds the option to display icons for the technologies your rivals are researching rather than their names 
(of course they are displayed only when you are allowed to know about them). 
It integrates the following (optional) mods:
  <UL>
  	<LI><SPAN style="color: #0000ff; font-weight: bold">'Dead Civ Scoreboard'</SPAN> by <SPAN style="font-weight: bold">TheLopez</SPAN><BR> 
  		will remove or gray out and/or mark as 'Dead' civilizations which have died within the game
  	<LI><SPAN style="color: #0000ff; font-weight: bold">'Attitude Icons'</SPAN> by <SPAN style="font-weight: bold">Porges</SPAN><BR>
  		will add smilies which change based on the civilizations attitude towards you.
  	<LI><SPAN style="color: #0000ff; font-weight: bold">'Score Delta'</SPAN> by <SPAN style="font-weight: bold">Caesium</SPAN><BR>
  		will display the score variation towards previous turn.
  	<LI><SPAN style="color: #0000ff; font-weight: bold">'Reversible Power Ratio'</SPAN> by <SPAN style="font-weight: bold">Dresden</SPAN><BR>
  		will allow to choose to calculate the power ratio as 'You vs. Them' (higher numbers are better) or 'Them vs. You' (lower numbers are better); 
  		it also allows you to select the number of decimal places for the ratio.
  </UL></P>

<P CLASS="style1">Instructions</P>
<P>The Advanced Scoreboard can be configured in the <A HREF="../Options/Scoreboard.html">Scoreboard</A> tab of the 
<b><i>BUG Options Screen</i></b> (<b>Alt+Ctrl+O</b>). 
Selecting the <i>'Advanced Layout: Enabled'</i> checkbox, you can fully customize the Scoreboard.</P>
<P>The <i>'Column Order'</i> text box allows you to choose which items to show in the Scoreboard and in which order, 
simply by typing the corresponding code in the box (the edit box has hover text detailing the available codes). 
The codes that you can use in this box, to display the corresponding items, are the following 
(note that the last three (*LO) are displayed only for your opponents in a multiplayer game, 
the first four (SZVC) and State Religion (R) are displayed even for your Civilization, while the others are displayed only for your opponents):<P>
