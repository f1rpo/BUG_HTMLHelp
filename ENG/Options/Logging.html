<P>Enables the automatic start of logging: 
if it is selected, logging starts automatically at the beginning of the game; 
if it is not selected, logging doesn't start automatically at the beginning of the game, 
but has to be started with the <b>[Alt+L]</b> command (which can also be pressed again to stop the logger).</P>
<br><br>
<P CLASS="style2">4000BC is Turn</P>
<P>This option will fix the problem with the game thinking your pre-turn is the first turn.
Default is 0, can be set to 1 for game default. This will not add a turn to the game, just logs it properly.</P>

<P>Uses the default name and path for the log file.</P>

<P CLASS="style2">Path</P>
<P>Default path is <i>...\My Docs\My Games\Beyond the Sword\Autolog</i>. You can change this to any directory you'd like.</P>
<P CLASS="style2">File</P>
<P>Default name uses the Name you selected for yourself within Civilization. You can change this as you like.</P>
<P CLASS="style2">Custom Entry Prefix</P>
<P>Allows you to use a customized prefix (for example your nickname on a forum) for your own entries in the log 
(the ones made using the <b>Alt+E</b> command).</P>
