<P CLASS="style1">The Taurus Mod</P>
<P><b>Taurus</b> is a fork of the <b>BULL</b> mod for <b>Civ IV: BtS</b> (Civilization IV: Beyond the Sword).<br>
BULL (the BUG DLL mod) enhances the <b>BUG</b> (BtS Unaltered Gameplay) mod with changes to the GameCore DLL file of BtS. The latest released versions, BUG 4.4 and BULL 1.2, were completed in May 2010. Later that year, BUG 4.5 and BULL 1.3 were essentially completed but didn't become official releases, and development ceased entirely in 2012. In June 2022, the Taurus mod is an attempt to update BULL with some of the usability enhancements that more comprehensive (rules-altering) BtS mods have made over the past decade.</p>

<p>The name is supposed to convey that Taurus has just the same goals as BULL but is very much a separate project, not associated with the original BULL developers. This clear break also frees Taurus from having to maintain the same high standards for maturity (not really achievable in today's diminished Civ IV community) and documentation.</p>

<p>The rest of this help file is mostly as in Oct 2008, that is, covering only BUG 3.5. (BULL was first released in 2009.) For an overview of the features added since then, please refer to <tt>BUG Changelog.txt</tt> and <tt>BULL Changelog.txt</tt> in the <tt>Taurus\Info</tt> folder and to the <a href="TaurusAdditions.html">Taurus Additions</a> help page. But, generally, the best documentation is the context help displayed on the Mod Options screen. The Credits tab of that screen is also mostly up to date.<br>
Some sentences from 2008 that no longer seem timely have been struck out, e.g. encouragement to contact the BUG team.</p>
