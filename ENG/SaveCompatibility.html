<P CLASS="style1">Savegame Compatibility</P>
<p>BtS, Taurus, BUG, BULL and many other lightweight mods use the same savegame format (save version 302). The only thing standing in the way of savegame compatibility is a check for the mod name performed by <tt>Civ4BeyondSword.exe</tt>, a file that, generally, can't be modified. Taurus uses a hack to work around this problem and will load BtS savegames and savegames created by any mod whose name starts with either "Taurus", "BUG", "BULL" or "BAT". These name checks ignore letter case, and the list of name prefixes can be extended in <tt>Taurus\Assets\XML\GlobalDefinesAlt.xml</tt>. One can also hold down the <font color="#0000ff">x</font> key at the start of the loading process to force <tt>Civ4BeyondSword.exe</tt> to accept the savegame regardless of the mod name. This will likely result in a crash to the desktop when the savegame has an incompatible format.</p>

<p>BUFFY (Hall of Fame) savegames cannot be loaded by Taurus because they're encrypted.</p>

<p align="justify">When loading a non-Taurus savegame that has the <font color="#0000ff">Lock Modified Assets</font> option enabled, Taurus will disable that option and bypass the modified-assets check in <tt>Civ4BeyondSword.exe</tt>. (That check would prevent the savegame from being loaded by any mod whose files differ in any way from those in the mod that created the savegame.)</p>

<p align="justify">By disabling the <font color="#0000ff">Save Mod Name</font> option (enabled by default) on the Saves tab of the mod options screen (Ctrl+Alt+O), Taurus can be prevented from writing its own name into savegames, thus allowing BtS (possibly with a mod installed under <tt>CustomAssets</tt>) to load Taurus savegames. Moreover, the key combination Ctrl+Shift+S can be used to bring up a dialog for <font color="#0000ff">exporting</font> the current game state into a savegame that either BtS or a particular (save version 302) mod will accept. For exporting to BtS, leave the text field empty; for exporting to another mod, enter the name of the mod (i.e. the name of its root folder). Exporting to BAT is possible too. The BAT savegame format differs a bit from 302, so Taurus will write the necessary extra data when the entered mod name starts with "BAT".</p>

<p align="justify">A frequently requested change in any DLL mod is a higher player limit. Unfortunately, this would break savegame compatibility, so, at best, an alternative <tt>CvGameCoreDLL.dll</tt> with, say, a 32-player limit could be provided. At this time, no such a DLL is not being distributed.</p>
