<P CLASS="style1">How to Install</P>

<p align="justify">Installation instructions for the BUG mod have been deleted from this page. Since most changes in Taurus involve the GameCore DLL, the separation between BUG as a non-DLL mod playable on MacOS and BULL as a less portable extension is discontinued - which simplifies installation.</p>

<p align="justify">Taurus is distributed only as a ZIP archive that needs to be extracted into the BtS <tt>Mods</tt> folder - either under <tt>Program Files</tt> or under <tt>My Games</tt>. BtS version 3.19 is required. The mod only runs on Windows or, possibly, on a Windows compatibility layer such as Wine (but no technical support can be provided for such non-native installations). <b>Steam</b> users will have to <a href="https://support.2k.com/hc/en-us/articles/202544073-Direct-IP-and-Installing-Pre-Steamworks-Civilization-IV-Unsupported-on-Steam" target=_blank>revert</a> to the GameSpy "beta" version to use Taurus; a <tt>Mods</tt> folder is located in  <tt>Steamapps\Common\Sid Meier's Civilization IV Beyond the
Sword\Beyond the Sword</tt>.</p>

<p align="justify">To start the mod through a Windows shortcut, create a shortcut to <tt>Civ4BeyondSword.exe</tt>, open the shortcut's file properties, and add a space and <tt>mod=\Taurus</tt> to the <tt>Target</tt> field. (In Steam, the mod can <a href="https://forums.civfanatics.com/threads/bat-install-failing-on-steam-beyond-the-sword.539120/page-2" target=_blank>reportedly</a> be loaded automatically through the "launch options" of BtS.) Installation into <tt>CustomAssets</tt> should be possible but is not recommended as mods in <tt>CustomAssets</tt> will interfere with mods in the <tt>Mods</tt> folder that fail to set <tt>NoCustomAssets=1</tt> in their <tt>INI</tt> file. An important benefit of installing BUG and BULL as custom assets was savegame-compatibility with BtS; Taurus is able to load and export BtS, BUG, BULL and BAT savegames; see the <a href="SaveCompatibility.html">Save Compatibility<a/> help page.</p>

<p align="justify"><tt>INI</tt> files with user interface settings are, for the most part, compatible between all BUG-based mods. To import settings from another BUG-based mod into Taurus, locate the <tt>UserSettings</tt> folder of that mod - either in the mod's folder under <tt>Beyond the Sword\Mods</tt> or under <tt>My Games\Beyond the Sword</tt> - and copy its contents into <tt>Mods\Taurus\UserSettings</tt>. The default Taurus settings can always be restored by clearing the <tt>UserSettings</tt> folder; the <tt>INI</tt> files then get recreated upon starting Taurus.</p>

<p align="justify">Taurus will not prevent artwork under <tt>CustomAssets</tt> from being loaded and should be fully compatible with the <a href="http://www.civfanatics.net/bluemarble/content/index.php" target=_blank>Blue Marble</a> mod and its Gold theme installed as custom assets. The Blue Marble terrain graphics can also be obtained as a FPK file from the archive linked at the end of <a href="https://forums.civfanatics.com/threads/k-mod-far-beyond-the-sword.407049/" target=_blank>this post</a> in the K-Mod CivFanatics forum. Taurus will load any FPK files placed in <tt>Taurus\Assets</tt>. A similar pack of terrain textures, closer to the original BtS textures, can be obtained <a href="https://github.com/f1rpo/AdvCiv/blob/master/Assets/BML.fpk" target=_blank>here</a> from the Advanced Civ mod.</p>
