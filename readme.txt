Project files for compiling the Taurus help files. About Taurus, please refer to:
https://www.github.com/f1rpo/Taurus

Based on the three CHM (Microsoft Compiled HTML Help) files distributed with the
BUG mod and originally authored using WinCHM. Those files were last updated in
Oct 2008 (for BUG 3.5):
https://sourceforge.net/p/civ4bug/code/1450/

I hadn't, at first, been aware that the WinCHM template files are available through
the BUG SVN history, so I decompiled the CHM files in HTML Help Workshop 4.74 and
revised the resulting project and table-of-contents files manually. This setup now
works well enough for me, so I'm going to stick with it.
