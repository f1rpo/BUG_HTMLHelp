<P CLASS="style1">The Taurus Mod</P>
<P><b>Taurus</b> is a fork of the <b>BULL</b> mod for <b>Civ IV: BtS</b> (Civilization IV: Beyond the Sword).<br>
BULL (the BUG DLL mod) enhances the <b>BUG</b> (BtS Unaltered Gameplay) mod with changes to the GameCore DLL file of BtS. The latest released versions, BUG 4.4 and BULL 1.2, were completed in May 2010. Later that year, BUG 4.5 and BULL 1.3 were essentially completed but didn't become official releases, and development ceased entirely in 2012. In May 2022, the Taurus mod is an attempt to update BULL with some of the usability enhancements that more comprehensive (rules-altering) BtS mods have made over the past decade.</p>

<p>The name is supposed to convey that Taurus has just the same goals as BULL but is very much a separate project, not associated with the original BULL developers. This clear break also frees Taurus from having to maintain the same high standards for maturity (not really achievable in today's diminished Civ IV community) and documentation. On that latter note, this BUG help file is <b>not</b> going to be expanded to cover BULL features or BUG features added after May 2010. Generally, the context help on the mod's options screen should be sufficient. For an overview of the changes in BUG 4.5 and of BULL, please refer to <tt>BUG Changelog.txt</tt> and <tt>BULL Changelog.txt</tt> in the <tt>Taurus\Info</tt> folder.</p>

<p>The rest of this help file is mostly as in 2010. Some sentences that no longer seem timely, e.g. encouragement to contact the BUG team, have been struck out.</p>
