<P CLASS="style1">Support for Networked Multiplayer</P>
<p>Networked multiplayer modes require the game to run perfectly synchronized on the host and all guests. Two BULL options are known to cause games to go out of sync unless either everyone keeps them enabled or everyone keeps them disabled:
<ol>
<li><font color="#0000ff">Pre-Chop</font><ul>
<li><font color="#0000ff">Forests</font></li>
<li><font color="#0000ff">Improvements</font></li>
</ul></li>
<li><font color="#0000ff">Sentry Healing</font><ul>
<li><font color="#0000ff">Enabled</font></li>
<li><font color="#0000ff">Only in Neutral Territory</font></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
Note that some rare bugs affecting synchronization exist already in BtS and are not (so far) fixed by Taurus. That is, the occasional non-reproducible out-of-sync error does not imply that BULL is causing problems.</p>
<p>Since Taurus makes no gameplay changes beyond those in the Unofficial Patch (UP), it should be able to stay in sync with other mods based on - and not going beyond - the UP. That's mainly just BULL. Since the last official BULL release (BULL 1.2) is based on UP 1.5, Taurus disables the (few) gameplay changes in UP 1.6 in all network games. For mutual savegame compatibility with BULL players, Taurus should be configured to write whatever mod name the BULL players use (e.g. "BUGBULL") into savegames. To accomplish that, set the <tt>REPLACEMENT_MOD_NAME</tt> variable in <tt>Taurus\Assets\XML\GlobalDefinesAlt.xml</tt> to the desired mod name and disable the <font color="#0000ff">Save Mod Name</font> option on the System tab of the mod options screen,  Please note, however, that interoperability with BULL has scarcely been tested; ideally, all participants of a network game should use the exact same version of the same mod. PitBoss games have not been tested at all.</p>
<p>Play By E-Mail only relies on mutual savegame-compatibility for synchronization; therefore, through the <tt>REPLACEMENT_MOD_NAME</tt> variable, Taurus should be interoperable with any mod whose savegame format is compatible with Taurus.</p>
