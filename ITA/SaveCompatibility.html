<P CLASS="style1">Savegame Compatibility</P>
<p>BtS, Taurus, BUG, BULL and many other lightweight mods use the same savegame format (save version 302). The only thing standing in the way of savegame compatibility is a check for the mod name performed by <tt>Civ4BeyondSword.exe</tt>, a file that, generally, can't be modified. Taurus uses a hack to work around this problem and will load BtS savegames and savegames created by any mod whose name starts with either "Taurus", "BUG", "BULL", "BAT" or "BUFFY". These name checks ignore letter case, and the list of name prefixes can be extended in <tt>Taurus\Assets\XML\GlobalDefinesAlt.xml</tt>. There is also a new option <font color="#0000ff">Load Any Savegame</font> on the BtS options screen (the one accessible under "Advanced" on the opening menu) that disables the name check entirely.</p>

<p>By default, Taurus does not write its own name into savegames, meaning that both BtS (possibly with a mod installed under <tt>CustomAssets</tt>) and other Taurus installations can load Taurus savegames. Through the <font color="#0000ff">Saved Mod Name</font> text field on the System tab of the mod options screen (Ctrl+Alt+O), any mod name can be written into Taurus savegames, allowing Taurus to "export" its savegames for use by any mod that is able to load save version 302.</p>

<p>A frequently requested change in any DLL mod is a higher player limit. Unfortunately, this would break savegame compatibility, so, at best, an alternative <tt>CvGameCoreDLL.dll</tt> with, say, a 32-player limit could be provided. At this time, no such a DLL is not being distributed.</p>
